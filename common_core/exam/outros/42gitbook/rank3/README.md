## Exam Rank 03

```
This exam a little less complicated than the first one you did. Just do one of the two exercises you come across, and you're done. 

Here are the two exercises you may be asked to do:

    ft_printf

        This one is pretty simple, you need to implement only a part of the conversion from the original printf: %x, %s and %d. Pretty easy.

    get_next_line

        A while back, this exercise wasn't compile with the -D BUFFER_SIZE flag, so it could be done on three (3) lines of code. But the subject changed, and now you have to build a complete get_next_line.

Ant that's it ! Well... we won't lie to each other. If you get printf it's very fast and easy ðŸ˜„  But if you get get_next_line, good luck ;)
